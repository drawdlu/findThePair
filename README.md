# Find the Pair Game

## Description
This is a simple game where you click the cards to reveal the items behind it. Only 2 cards can open at a time and it will remain open only when you find a pair (two images that are the same). Once you find all the pairs it will prompt for the next round. When you reach the last round (4) it will just prompt for a new game.  

## Languages used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- the reason for just sticking to these 3 languages is to practice what I have learned after finishing The Odin Project Foundations
